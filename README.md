# DTT Unity Game

## Overview
This project is a maze generator build in Unity, for an assessment by DTT.
The project includes a procedural maze generator, and a bonus feature: first-person mode, which can be toggled on PC using the "Tab" key.

I enjoyed working on this assignment, trying my best to balance my time working on this project alongside my school commitments. The project allowed me to explore procedural generation techniques which I was unfamiliar with, which I was able to learn a lot from.

## Challenges and Reflections
- **Time Management**: As i mentioned before, balancing this project with school assignments was a challenge, but gave me a respite from the "less interesting" school assignments.
- **UI and UX**: It saddens me that I wasn't able to implement my UI and UX experience since I was running short on time, in the future I might come back to this project to add some visualization.
